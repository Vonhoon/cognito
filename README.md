# Cognito - AURA Interface

## Overview
Cognito - AURA Interface is a sci-fi/retro-futuristic simulation and chatbot application built with PySide6. It features an AI assistant named "AURA" that guides the user through a narrative involving a solar flare event. The interface mimics a terminal environment with specialized visual and audio effects.

The core conversational engine is powered by Google's Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash).

## Features
- **Narrative-Driven Chat:** Engage with AURA, an AI assistant with distinct personality traits and evolving states.
- **Simulated OS Environment:** Experience a retro-futuristic terminal with simulated system checks, "scare" sequences (BSOD, glitches), and sound effects.
- **Language Support:** Bilingual interface support for English and Korean.
- **Custom Visuals:** Uses a custom font ("Neo둥근모") and a specific color palette (Green/Amber/Red on Dark Background).
- **Gemini AI Integration:** Real-time responses generated by Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Google AI Studio API Key:** You need a valid API key to use the generative AI features. Get one [here](https://aistudio.google.com/).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install PySide6 google-generativeai
    ```

3.  **Setup Assets:**
    Ensure the following files are present in the project root:
    - `cognito_v0.1.py`: Main application script.
    - `neodgm_code.ttf`: Custom font file.
    - `sounds/`: Directory containing sound effects (`power_down.wav`, `bsod_error.wav`, `glitch.wav`).

4.  **Configure API Key:**
    Create a file named `api_key.txt` in the root directory of the project. Paste your Google AI Studio API key into this file.
    ```text
    YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

## Usage

Run the main script to launch the application:

```bash
python cognito_v0.1.py
```

### Controls
- **Language Selection:** Upon launch, select your preferred language (English or Korean).
- **Chat:** Type your messages in the input field and press Enter or click "Send".
- **Internet/MCP Toggles:** Use the buttons at the bottom to enable simulated "Internet" and "Main Computing Power" (MCP) access as the narrative progresses.
- **Developer Mode:** Certain states or key combinations (context menu) may unlock a "Developer Mode" panel for advanced interaction and debugging simulated issues.

## Credits
- **Font:** Neo둥근모 (NeoDGM) Code.
- **AI Model:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash.
